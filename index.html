            <h3> Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
             Origami paper is designed to be thin enough to fold easily and hold the crease without being bulky, yet strong enough to resist tears. ... Once you know a bit about the most common types of origami paper and are wowed by the beautiful colors and designs, you may find yourself wanting one of each!
            Given below are the steps/ways that you have to follow to make an origami.
